# Docker Homebridge

This Alpine/Debian Linux based Docker image allows you to run [Nfarina's](https://github.com/nfarina) [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) on your home network which emulates the iOS HomeKit API.

This is a multi-arch image and will also run on a Raspberry Pi or other Docker-enabled ARMv6/7/8 devices.

## Guides

- [Running Homebridge on a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-on-Raspberry-Pi)
- [Running Homebridge on a Synology NAS](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-on-Synology)

## Compatibility

Homebridge requires full access to your local network to function correctly which can be achieved using the ```--net=host``` flag.
Currently this image will not work when using [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) due to [this](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/68) and [this](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/543).


## Usage

```shell
docker run \
  --net=host \
  --name=homebridge \
  -e PUID=<UID> -e PGID=<GID> \
  -e TZ=<timezone> \
  -e HOMEBRIDGE_CONFIG_UI=1 \
  -e HOMEBRIDGE_CONFIG_UI_PORT=8080 \
  -v </path/to/config>:/homebridge \
  oznu/homebridge
```

## Raspberry Pi

This docker image has been tested on the following Raspberry Pi models:

* Raspberry Pi 1 Model B
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
* Raspberry Pi Zero W

[See the wiki for a guide on getting Homebridge up and running on a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-on-Raspberry-Pi).

## Parameters

The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side.

* `--net=host` - Shares host networking with container, **required**
* `-v /homebridge` - The Homebridge config and plugin location
* `-e TZ` - for [timezone information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) e.g. `-e TZ=Europe/London`
* `-e PGID` - for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` - for UserID - see below for explanation

##### *Optional Settings:*

* `-e PACKAGES` - Additional [packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages) to install (comma separated, no spaces) e.g. `-e PACKAGES=openssh`
* `-e TERMINATE_ON_ERROR=1` - If `TERMINATE_ON_ERROR` is set to `1` then the container will exit when the Homebridge process ends, otherwise it will be restarted.
* `-e HOMEBRIDGE_INSECURE=1` - Start homebridge in insecure mode using the `-I` flag.
* `-e HOMEBRIDGE_DEBUG=1` - Enable debug level logging using the `-D` flag.

##### *Homebridge UI Options*:

This is the only supported method of running [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) on oznu/homebridge.

* `-e HOMEBRIDGE_CONFIG_UI=1` - Enable and configure [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) which allows you to manage and configure Homebridge from your web browser.
* `-e HOMEBRIDGE_CONFIG_UI_PORT=8080` - The port to run [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) on. Defaults to port 8080.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work".

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Homebridge Config

The Homebridge config file is located at ```</path/to/config>/config.json```
This file will be created the first time you run the container if it does not already exist.

## Homebridge Plugins

Plugins should be defined in the ```</path/to/config>/package.json``` file in the standard NPM format.
This file will be created the first time you run the container if it does not already exist.

Any plugins added to the `package.json` will be installed each time the container is restarted.
Plugins can be uninstalled by removing the entry from the `package.json` and restarting the container.

You can also install plugins using `npm` which will automatically update the package.json file as you add and remove modules.

**You must restart the container after installing or removing plugins for the changes to take effect.**

### To add plugins using npm:

```
docker exec <container name or id> npm install <module name>
```

Example:

```
docker exec homebridge npm install homebridge-dummy
```

### To remove plugins using npm:

```
docker exec <container name or id> npm remove <module name>
```

Example:

```
docker exec homebridge npm remove homebridge-dummy
```

### To add plugins using `startup.sh` script:

The first time you run the container a script named [`startup.sh`](/root/defaults/startup.sh) will be created in your mounted `/homebridge` volume. This script is executed everytime the container is started, before Homebridge loads, and can be used to install plugins if you don't want to edit the `package.json` file manually.

To add plugins using the `startup.sh` script just use the `npm install` command:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

npm install homebridge-dummy
```

This container does **NOT** require you to install plugins globally (using `npm install -g` or `yarn global add`) and doing so is **NOT** recommended or supported.

## Docker Compose

If you prefer to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  homebridge:
    image: oznu/homebridge:latest
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - TZ=Australia/Sydney
      - PGID=1000
      - PUID=1000
      - HOMEBRIDGE_CONFIG_UI=1
      - HOMEBRIDGE_CONFIG_UI_PORT=8080
    volumes:
      - ./volumes/homebridge:/homebridge
```

## Troubleshooting

#### 1. Verify your config.json and package.json syntax

Many issues appear because of invalid JSON. A good way to verify your config is to use the [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/) validator.

#### 2. When running on Synology DSM set the `DSM_HOSTNAME` environment variable

You may need to provide the server name of your Synology NAS using the `DSM_HOSTNAME` environment variable to prevent [hostname conflict errors](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/issues/35). The value of the `DSM_HOSTNAME` environment should exactly match the server name as shown under `Synology DSM Control Panel` -> `Info Centre` -> `Server name`, it should contain no spaces or special characters.

#### 3. Need ffmpeg?

ffmpeg, with `libfdk-aac` audio support is included in this image.

#### 4. Try the debian tag

Some plugins don't like Alpine Linux so this project also provides a Debian based version of the image.

```
docker run oznu/homebridge:debian
docker run oznu/homebridge:debian-arm32v7
```

See the wiki for a list of image variants: https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki

#### 5. Logs showing `Service name conflict` or `Host name conflict`

You may need to use a `no-avahi` version of this image to prevent conflicts with the Avahi service running on the host:

```shell
# Alpine
docker run oznu/homebridge:no-avahi
docker run oznu/homebridge:no-avahi-arm32v6
docker run oznu/homebridge:no-avahi-arm64v8

# Debian
docker run oznu/homebridge:debian-no-avahi
docker run oznu/homebridge:debian-no-avahi-arm32v7
```

See the wiki for a list of image variants: https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki
